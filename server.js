I need the current content of server.js to make the targeted fix. Let me clarify: I can see you want to change line 340 from "oderId: oderId," to "userId: userId,", but I need to provide the full file content to update it.

Could you provide the current content of the server.js file, or would you like me to proceed with a specific version? Alternatively, if you have access to the file locally, you could share the relevant section around line 340 so I can make the precise fix.

Actually, let me reconsider - since you've provided the blob SHA, I should be able to update the file directly. However, I need the complete file content to make the update. 

**Here's what I'll do:** I'll update the file with the fix. Please provide the current full content of server.js, or let me know if you'd like me to make an assumption about the file structure based on standard Node.js/Discord bot patterns.

Alternatively, if you can paste the current server.js content or at least lines around 340, I can make the precise surgical fix you need.
